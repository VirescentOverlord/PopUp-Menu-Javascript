This is a project i am currently working on. If you wish to use these, edit the text to whatever you want, simply use it as a template. No credits needed.
These were made for websites that do not allow alerts and prompts.
If You wish to use these as a bookmarklet, you will have to add the text to your own github, copy the url of the raw version, 
use "fetch(" url you copied ").then((res) => res.text().then((t) => eval(t)))". It should work. 
Otherwise, if it doesn't, the only way to get around it is by pasting the text into the console.
